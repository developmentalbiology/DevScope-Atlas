# DevScope-Atlas

 Curated scripts for collecting, harmonizing, and pre-processing human developmental single-cell
  datasets.

  ## What’s inside?

  - **Data Collection** – utilities for fetching public embryo/developmental scRNA-seq resources and
  unifying metadata.
  - **QC & Preprocessing** – Scanpy-flavoured workflows for filtering, normalization, and embedding
  generation.
  - **Reference Assets** – marker panels, annotation dictionaries, and shared ontology mappings to keep
  analyses consistent.
